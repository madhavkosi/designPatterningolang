### What Happens During Deployment

1. **Code Retrieval**: CI/CD pipeline fetches the latest code from the repository.
2. **Build Process**: Application code is built, dependencies are installed, and the application is compiled.
3. **Testing**: Automated tests run to ensure code functionality and quality.
4. **Artifact Creation**: A deployment package (e.g., ZIP file, Docker image) is created from the built code.
5. **Artifact Deployment**: The deployment package is uploaded to the chosen Azure service (App Service, AKS, etc.).
6. **Service Configuration**: The Azure service is set up to use the new deployment package.
7. **Application Start**: The application starts running with the newly deployed code.
