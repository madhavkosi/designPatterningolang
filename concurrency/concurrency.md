### Program, Process, and Thread: A Quick Look

#### Program
- **Definition**: A set of instructions stored on a computer. It is a static entity that remains inactive until executed.
- **Example**: A program designed to search through billions of database entries, stored passively on the hard drive until initiated.

#### Process
- **Definition**: The active state of a program when it is run or executed, using memory and other system resources.
- **Example**: The database search program becomes a process when executed, actively utilizing system resources to perform its tasks.

#### Thread
- **Definition**: A part of a process. Threads are used to split a process into multiple tasks to work more efficiently.
- **Example**: In the database search process, multiple threads can be created to search different portions of the database concurrently (e.g., one thread handles the first 250 million records, another handles the next 250 million).

#### Comparison: Program vs. Process vs. Thread

| Aspect                     | Program/Application                                            | Process/Executing Entity                                         | Thread/Concurrent Entity                              |

| **Description**            | A collection of instructions to accomplish a task.            | A single running instance of a program.                          | A path of execution within a process.                |
| **Autonomy**               | A component within larger systems.                            | It has its own address space and runs independently.             | Executes in parallel with other threads within the same process. |
| **Resource Management**    | Doesn't actively manage them.                                 | Manages its own memory and resources.                            | Shares the memory space of its parent process.       |
| **Example**                | An executable created to sift through billions of database entries, remaining inactive until executed. | The executable becomes an active process, utilizing system memory and resources. | Within the process, individual threads can search specific database segments concurrently. |

#### Importance of Threads
- **Concurrency**: Threads enable concurrent execution within a program, allowing tasks to be divided and executed simultaneously, increasing efficiency and speed.
- **Resource Sharing**: Threads within a process share the same memory space, making communication and data sharing between threads efficient.
