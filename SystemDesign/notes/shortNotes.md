### CAP Theorem 
**Components of CAP Theorem**

The CAP theorem revolves around three key properties of distributed systems: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance.

**a. Consistency**
- **Strong Consistency**: All nodes see the same data at the same time. Any read returns the most recent write. Essential for applications needing accurate, up-to-date data (e.g., financial transactions).
- **Eventual Consistency**: Nodes may have different data temporarily but will converge to the same state. Suitable for applications tolerating short-term inconsistencies (e.g., social media updates).

**b. Availability**
- **High Availability**: The system responds to every request without significant delays, even during failures. Achieved by replicating data across nodes, ensuring continued operation despite individual node failures.

**c. Partition Tolerance**
- **Network Partitioning**: Occurs when communication between nodes is interrupted. Caused by hardware failures, network congestion, etc.
- **Handling Partition Failures**: Systems remain operational despite partitions, using data replication, fallback mechanisms, and recovery processes. Trade-offs are necessary as the system cannot guarantee all three CAP properties simultaneously.

**CAP Theorem Overview**

- **Consistency (C):** All nodes see the same data at the same time, Every read receives the most recent write or an error.
- **Availability (A):** Every request receives a non-error response, without guaranteeing it contains the most recent write,The system responds to every request
- **Partition Tolerance (P):** The system continues to operate despite network partitions.

**Examples in Practice**

  - **Availability:** Operations can be performed even with node issues.
  - **Partition Tolerance:** Handles partitions gracefully.
  - **Consistency:** Eventual consistency by default, strong consistency as an option.
  - **Use Case:** E-commerce platforms, gaming leaderboards.

 **Consistency and Availability (CA)**
- **Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) like MySQL/PostgreSQL:**
  - **Consistency:** Ensures strong consistency with ACID transactions.
  - **Availability:** Available as long as the network is reliable.
  - **Partition Tolerance:** Not designed for handling network partitions.
  - **Use Case:** Banking systems, e-commerce transactions.

 **Conclusion**

- **CP Systems:** Prioritize consistency and integrity (e.g., financial systems).
- **AP Systems:** Prioritize uptime and resilience (e.g., social media).
- **CA Systems:** Used where network partitions are rare, ensuring both consistency and availability (e.g., traditional databases).

### Bloom Filters
**Introduction to Bloom Filters**

A **Bloom filter** is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure used to test whether an element is a member of a set. It can provide a quick answer to membership queries with the possibility of false positives but no false negatives. This means it may incorrectly report that an element is in the set when it is not, but it will never incorrectly report that an element is not in the set when it is.

**Key Concepts**

- **Probabilistic Nature:** Bloom filters allow for false positives but no false negatives. This means they may mistakenly identify that an element is in the set when it isn't, but they will always correctly identify elements that are actually in the set.
  
- **Space Efficiency:** They are much more space-efficient compared to other data structures like hash tables or arrays for storing sets, especially for large datasets.

- **Hash Functions:** Multiple hash functions are used to map elements to several positions in a bit array.

**How Bloom Filters Work**

1. **Initialization:**
   - Start with a bit array of size \( m \), initialized to 0.
   - Choose \( k \) different hash functions.

2. **Adding an Element:**
   - For an element \( x \) to be added to the set, pass it through the \( k \) hash functions to get \( k \) positions in the bit array.
   - Set the bits at all these positions to 1.

3. **Querying an Element:**
   - To check if an element \( y \) is in the set, pass it through the \( k \) hash functions to get \( k \) positions.
   - Check if all these positions are set to 1. If yes, the element is probably in the set. If not, the element is definitely not in the set.

 **Applications**

- **Web Caching:** To quickly check if an element is in the cache.
- **Database Queries:** To reduce disk lookups for non-existent records.
- **Networking:** In packet routing and intrusion detection systems.
- **Distributed Systems:** To efficiently synchronize data between nodes.

 **Advantages**

- **Space Efficient:** Requires significantly less memory compared to other data structures.
- **Fast:** Very quick to add and check for elements, with operations typically being O(k), where k is the number of hash functions.

 **Disadvantages**

- **False Positives:** Can incorrectly indicate the presence of an element.
- **No Removal:** Standard Bloom filters do not support the removal of elements. Once a bit is set to 1, it cannot be unset.

 **Variations**

- **Counting Bloom Filters:** Allow for the removal of elements by maintaining a count of the number of elements hashed to each position in the bit array.
- **Scalable Bloom Filters:** Dynamically adjust the size of the bit array and number of hash functions to maintain a desired false positive rate as more elements are added.

 **Conclusion**

Bloom filters are an effective tool for membership testing when space is a constraint, and occasional false positives are acceptable. They are widely used in various applications requiring efficient and fast membership queries, balancing the trade-off between accuracy and resource usage.


**Applications of Bloom Filters**

1. **Database Systems**
   - **Query Optimization:** Used as a pre-filter to avoid unnecessary disk reads for non-existent keys, enhancing query performance.
   - **Network Overhead Reduction:** Minimizes remote requests for non-existent data in distributed databases.

2. **Network Routing and Traffic Analysis**
   - **Packet Monitoring:** Tracks IP addresses or packet identifiers to detect and eliminate duplicates, reducing bandwidth usage.
   - **Traffic Analysis:** Performs real-time analysis of network traffic patterns to identify trends and anomalies.

3. **Web Caching and Content Distribution**
   - **Cache Efficiency:** Helps proxy servers quickly determine cache contents, reducing cache misses and network requests.
   - **CDN Optimization:** Optimizes resource allocation and replication in content distribution networks (CDNs).

4. **Spam Filtering and Malware Detection**
   - **Signature Matching:** Maintains compact representations of spam or malware signatures for efficient filtering of unwanted content.
   - **Space Efficiency:** Suitable for applications requiring large sets of signatures to be maintained and updated.

5. **Distributed Systems Membership Testing**
   - **Efficient Synchronization:** Nodes exchange Bloom filters to quickly identify dataset differences and synchronize efficiently.
   - **Performance Improvement:** Reduces the amount of data exchanged, enhancing overall system performance and scalability.

**Summary**
Bloom filters provide space-efficient solutions across various applications, including database query optimization, network routing, web caching, spam filtering, and distributed systems membership testing, improving performance and resource usage.


### **Long-Polling, WebSockets, and Server-Sent Events**
**Difference Between Long-Polling, WebSockets, and Server-Sent Events**

**Long-Polling:**
- **Description:** Client sends a request to the server and keeps the connection open until new data is available or a timeout occurs.
- **Use Case:** Used when real-time updates are needed with less frequent updates, minimizing unnecessary requests.
- **Protocol:** Relies on HTTP for request-response mechanism, but the server delays responses until data is ready.

**WebSockets:**
- **Description:** Provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection, enabling bi-directional, real-time data transfer.
- **Use Case:** Ideal for applications requiring continuous data exchange between client and server, such as chat applications, live updates, and interactive games.
- **Protocol:** Establishes a persistent connection after an initial handshake, allowing both server and client to initiate data transfer.

**Server-Sent Events (SSEs):**
- **Description:** Establishes a persistent connection where the server sends updates to the client whenever new data is available.
- **Use Case:** Suitable for applications needing server-initiated updates, such as live feeds, stock tickers, and notifications.
- **Protocol:** Uses HTTP to maintain a long-lived connection, with the server streaming events to the client.

**Summary**
- **Long-Polling:** Efficient for scenarios with infrequent updates, reducing unnecessary network traffic.
- **WebSockets:** Enables continuous, real-time communication between client and server, suitable for interactive and dynamic applications.
- **Server-Sent Events:** Supports one-way communication from server to client for real-time updates, maintaining a persistent connection.


Certainly! Here's an updated version of the notes on quorum in distributed systems, including a formula:

### Quorum in Distributed Systems

**Definition:**
- **Quorum** is the minimum number of nodes required to perform a distributed operation, ensuring consistency and fault tolerance.

**Purpose:**
- Ensures that distributed operations (read/write) are consistent across replicas.
- Guarantees that enough nodes are online to make decisions even in the event of node failures.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Majority Agreement:** Requires a majority of nodes (typically more than half) to agree on a decision (commit or abort) for a transaction.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Systems with quorum can tolerate node failures up to a certain threshold (e.g., in a 5-node cluster, can tolerate up to 2 node failures if quorum is 3).

**Implementation:**
- **Quorum Formula:** \( Q =Ciel of N / 2  + 1 \)
  - Where \( Q \) is the quorum size,
  - \( N \) is the total number of nodes in the cluster.

- Quorum configurations (e.g., N=total nodes, W=write nodes, R=read nodes) determine the balance between consistency, availability, and performance.
- Common configurations: 
  - (N=3, W=2, R=2): Strong consistency with balanced read and write operations.
  - (N=3, W=1, R=3): Fast writes, slower reads, less durable.
  - (N=3, W=3, R=1): Slow writes, fast reads, highly durable.

**Best Practices:**
- Prefer an odd number of nodes to ensure a majority quorum (e.g., 3, 5, 7 nodes).
- Choose quorum settings based on application needs (performance vs. consistency).

**Conclusion:**
- Quorum ensures that distributed systems maintain consistency and availability, crucial for reliable operation in fault-tolerant environments.

These notes with the added quorum formula provide a comprehensive understanding of how quorum operates in distributed systems, highlighting its importance in achieving reliability and consistency across distributed data.



### HeartBeat

**Managing Server Failures in Distributed Systems**

**Challenge:**
- In distributed systems, work and data are spread across multiple servers.
- Servers need to efficiently route requests and know the status of other servers to maintain system reliability and performance.

**Requirements:**
- Servers must identify which server is responsible for handling each incoming request.
- Timely detection of server failures is crucial to prevent system degradation and ensure continuous operation.

**Solution - Heartbeating Mechanism:**
- **Heartbeating:** Servers periodically send heartbeat messages to indicate they are alive and functioning.
  - If a central monitoring server exists, all servers send heartbeats to it.
  - In decentralized systems, servers send heartbeats to a randomly selected subset of other servers.

- **Failure Detection:**
  - If a server fails to send a heartbeat within a configured timeout period, it is considered potentially failed.
  - The system stops routing requests to the suspected failed server and initiates replacement actions.

- **Benefits:**
  - **Fault Tolerance:** Enables the system to quickly detect and react to server failures, maintaining overall system availability.
  - **Automatic Recovery:** Initiates processes to replace failed servers, redistributing workload to maintain performance.

- **Implementation Considerations:**
  - **Timeout Settings:** Configure timeout periods for heartbeat detection based on expected network and server response times.
  - **Scalability:** Ensure the heartbeating mechanism scales with the number of servers and workload intensity.
  - **Redundancy:** Use redundancy in heartbeat recipients to ensure robust failure detection even if some servers are temporarily unreachable.

**Conclusion:**
- Heartbeating is essential in distributed systems for proactive server monitoring and failure detection.
- It enables systems to maintain operational stability by swiftly responding to failures and redistributing workload, ensuring continuous service availability.


### CheckSum

**Ensuring Data Integrity in Distributed Systems**

**Challenge:**
- In distributed systems, data corruption can occur during transmission due to faults in storage devices, networks, or software, leading to potential errors if corrupted data is delivered to clients.

**Solution - Using Checksums:**
- **Checksum Calculation:** 
  - Calculate a checksum using a cryptographic hash function (e.g., MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512) on the data.
  - A checksum is a fixed-length string derived from the input data, uniquely representing its content.

- **Implementation:**
  - **Storage:** When storing data, compute the checksum and store it alongside the data.
  - **Verification:** When retrieving data, the client recalculates the checksum of the received data.
    - If the recalculated checksum matches the stored checksum, the data integrity is confirmed.
    - If checksums do not match, it indicates data corruption or tampering.

- **Error Handling:**
  - If checksum verification fails, the client can request the data from another replica or notify the user of a data integrity issue.
  - This ensures that clients receive errors or can retry fetching data from a reliable source rather than accepting potentially corrupt data.

**Benefits:**
- **Data Integrity:** Guarantees that data received by clients is accurate and uncorrupted.
- **Error Detection:** Provides an efficient method to detect data corruption or transmission errors.
- **Reliability:** Enables clients to retrieve accurate data by verifying checksums, enhancing overall system reliability.

**Considerations:**
- **Hash Function Selection:** Choose a hash function based on security needs and performance considerations.
- **Implementation Overhead:** Calculate checksums efficiently to minimize computational overhead during data operations.
- **Consistency:** Ensure consistency in checksum calculation and verification across distributed nodes.

**Conclusion:**
- Using checksums based on cryptographic hash functions ensures data integrity in distributed systems, allowing clients to detect and handle data corruption effectively.
- It provides a robust mechanism for error detection and recovery, enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of distributed system operations.

These notes cover the importance of checksums in maintaining data integrity within distributed systems, emphasizing their role in error detection and ensuring clients receive reliable data.


Certainly! Here's an integrated explanation that incorporates the concept of the Leader and Follower Pattern in the context of ensuring data consistency and availability in distributed systems:

### Leader and Follower Pattern in Distributed Systems

**Background:**
- Distributed systems maintain multiple copies of data for fault tolerance and availability.
- Quorum ensures consistency by requiring a majority of nodes to participate in operations. However, it can reduce availability if nodes are unavailable.
- Ensuring data consistency remains a challenge, especially during failures that can lead to inconsistent data across replicas.

**Solution - Leader and Follower Pattern:**
- **Role Definition:**
  - **Leader:** A single server elected to manage data replication and coordinate operations across the distributed system. The leader is responsible for initiating writes and ensuring data consistency.
  - **Follower:** Servers that replicate data from the leader and serve as backups. Followers accept writes only from the leader and maintain data consistency through replication.

- **Operation:**
  - **Data Replication:** Only the leader performs write operations, ensuring that all updates are initially made to a single source of truth.
  - **Coordination:** The leader acts as a central point for coordinating read and write operations across the system. Followers replicate data from the leader to maintain consistency.
  - **Failure Handling:** If the leader fails, a follower can be dynamically promoted to the leader role through leader election algorithms like Paxos or Raft. This ensures continuity in data replication and system operation.
  - **Load Balancing:** Followers can also serve read requests to distribute the load from clients, enhancing system performance under normal operation.

**Conclusion:**
- The Leader and Follower Pattern is a strategic approach in distributed systems to balance data consistency, availability, and fault tolerance.
- By designating a single leader for write operations and employing followers for replication and backup, the pattern ensures efficient data management and system reliability in complex distributed environments.


### Consistent Hashing


**The Rehashing Problem**

In distributed systems, distributing requests and data evenly across servers is crucial for efficient load balancing. A common method to balance the load among \( n \) cache servers is:

\[ \text{serverIndex} = \text{hash(key)} \% N \]

Here, \( N \) is the total number of servers. For example, with 4 servers and 8 keys, applying the hash function and modulus operation assigns each key to a specific server. However, this method fails when servers are added or removed. Removing a server changes \( N \), causing a significant redistribution of keys, leading to many cache misses and inefficiencies.

**Consistent Hashing**

Consistent hashing solves the rehashing problem by minimizing the number of keys that need to be remapped when the number of servers changes. This technique ensures only a small fraction of keys are redistributed.

**Hash Space and Hash Ring**

Using a hash function like SHA-1, we map the output range (0 to \( 2^{160} - 1 \)) onto a circular hash ring. Servers and keys are then mapped onto this ring.

**Server and Key Mapping**

Servers are assigned positions on the hash ring using their IP or name. Keys are also hashed and placed on the ring. To find the server for a key, we move clockwise from the key's position until we encounter a server.

**Adding and Removing Servers**

When a new server is added, only the keys between the new server and its predecessor need to be redistributed. Similarly, removing a server only affects the keys between the removed server and its predecessor.

**Issues with Basic Consistent Hashing**

1. **Uneven Partition Sizes**: When servers are added or removed, partition sizes (the hash space between adjacent servers) can become uneven, leading to load imbalance.
2. **Non-uniform Key Distribution**: Keys may cluster around certain servers, causing uneven load distribution.

**Virtual Nodes**

To address these issues, servers are represented by multiple virtual nodes on the hash ring. This results in a more balanced distribution of keys. Each server handles multiple partitions, which reduces the variance in partition sizes and distributes keys more evenly.

**Redistributing Keys**

When servers are added or removed, only keys in the affected range (between the new or removed server and its predecessor) need to be redistributed. This minimizes disruption and maintains efficient load balancing.

**Applications and Benefits**

Consistent hashing is widely used in systems like Amazon's Dynamo, Apache Cassandra, Discord, Akamai CDN, and Maglev load balancer. It allows for easy horizontal scaling, minimizes key redistribution, and mitigates the hotspot key problem by distributing data more evenly across servers.


### Proxy Server

- **Definition:** A server that sits in front of client machines and acts as an intermediary between the clients and the internet.
- **Function:** Forwards client requests to the internet and returns the responses back to the clients.
- **Usage:** Caching data, filtering requests, logging requests, transforming requests (adding/removing headers, encrypting/decrypting, compressing resources).
- **Benefits:** Hides the identity of the client from the server, optimizes request traffic through techniques like collapsed forwarding (combining multiple requests into one).

**Example Diagram:**
```
Client -> Proxy Server -> Internet
          (e.g., facebook.com Server)
```

**Reverse Proxy:**
- **Definition:** A server that sits in front of web servers and acts as an intermediary between the web servers and the internet.
- **Function:** Forwards client requests to the appropriate web server and returns the responses to the clients.
- **Usage:** Hides the identity of the server from the client, provides caching, load balancing, routing requests.
- **Benefits:** Protects the server's identity, can improve security and performance.

**Example Diagram:**
```
Client -> Reverse Proxy -> Internal Network -> Web Servers
          (e.g., facebook.com Server 1, facebook.com Server 2)
```

**Forward Proxy:** Request/Response Transformation, Caching, Client Anonymity, Traffic Control, Logging.

**Reverse Proxy:** URL/Content Rewriting, Caching, Server Anonymity, Load Balancing, Canary Experimentation, DDoS Protection.

### Caching
**Introduction to Caching**

**What is Caching?**
- **Definition:** High-speed storage layer between an application and its data source. (e.g., database, file system, remote web service).
- **Function:** Checks cache first for data; if not found, fetches from the original source and stores it in the cache.
- **Goal:** Reduce the frequency of fetching data from the original source, leading to faster processing and reduced latency.

**Why is Caching Important?**

1. **Reduced Latency:** Faster data retrieval from cache compared to the original source.
2. **Improved Performance:** Less frequent data fetching from the original source speeds up processing.
3. **Reduced Network Load:** Minimizes data transmission over the network by storing data locally.
4. **Increased Scalability:** Lowers the load on the original source, preventing it from being overwhelmed.
5. **Better User Experience:** Faster response times enhance user satisfaction.

**Types of Caching**

1. **In-Memory Caching:** Fastest, stores data in RAM. Ideal for frequently accessed data like API responses. Tools: Memcached, Redis.

2. **Disk Caching:** Stores data on the hard disk. Slower than RAM but faster than remote sources. Used for large data and persistence.

3. **Database Caching:** Stores frequently accessed data within the database. Reduces need for external storage access.

4. **Client-Side Caching:** Occurs on client devices (browsers, apps). Stores assets like images and scripts to reduce server requests.

5. **Server-Side Caching:** Occurs on the server. Stores frequently accessed or precomputed data to improve performance.

6. **CDN Caching:** Distributed servers store data to reduce latency for global users. Common for static assets like images and videos.
x
7. **DNS Caching:** Temporarily stores DNS query results to improve resolution speed and reduce repeated queries.

**Cache Replacement Policies**

1. **Least Recently Used (LRU):** Removes the least recently accessed item. Assumes recently accessed items are more likely to be used again.
use case Web Browsers,Database Buffers,Operating Systems

2. **Least Frequently Used (LFU):** Removes the least frequently accessed item. Assumes frequently accessed items are more likely to be used again.
Use Cases:Application Caches,Recommendation Systems,Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)

3. **First In, First Out (FIFO):** Removes the oldest item. Assumes older items are less likely to be accessed again.

4. **Random Replacement:** Removes a random item. Useful for unpredictable access patterns

 **Summary**
- **LRU** is best for scenarios where recently accessed data is likely to be accessed again soon.
- **LFU** suits applications with predictable access patterns where certain items are frequently accessed.

**Comparison:**
- **LRU & LFU:** More effective, account for access patterns, but more complex to implement.
- **FIFO & Random:** Simpler to implement, but less effective in optimizing performance. 

**Cache Invalidation**
Here is the information organized in a table:


| **Strategy**                | **Description**                                                                                                                                     | **Summary**                                                                                                                      |

**Cache Read Strategies**

**Read-Through Cache:**
- **Mechanism:** Cache handles data retrieval from the data store on a cache miss.
- **Process:** Application requests data from the cache. On a cache miss, the cache fetches data from the data store, updates itself, and returns the data to the application.
- **Benefits:** Simplifies application code, ensures consistency between cache and data store. Ideal when data store retrieval is expensive and cache misses are infrequent.

**Read-Aside Cache:**
- **Mechanism:** Application handles data retrieval from the data store on a cache miss.
- **Process:** Application checks the cache for data. On a cache miss, the application fetches data from the data store, updates the cache, and uses the data.
- **Benefits:** Provides better control over caching, allows optimization based on data access patterns. Suitable when cache misses are infrequent. Adds complexity to application code.

### Messaging System
#### Introduction to Messaging System

**Background:**
Distributed systems often face challenges in handling continuous data influx from multiple sources. A messaging system helps manage scenarios like log aggregation by decoupling data producers and consumers, providing an asynchronous way of transferring messages.

**What is a Messaging System?**
- Transfers data among services, applications, processes, or servers.
- Decouples different parts of a distributed system, focusing on data/message transfer without worrying about the sharing mechanism.

**Common Messaging Models:**

1. **Queue:**
   - **Mechanism:** Messages are stored sequentially in a queue. Producers push to the rear, and consumers extract from the front.
   - **Use Case:** Distributes message-processing among multiple consumers, but each message can be consumed by only one consumer.
   - **Example:** A log aggregation service processing log entries from multiple sources.

2. **Publish-Subscribe (Pub-Sub):**
   - **Mechanism:** Messages are divided into topics. Producers publish to a topic, and subscribers receive messages from the topic.
   - **Use Case:** Multiple consumers can receive the same message. Useful for scenarios where messages need to be broadcasted to multiple receivers.
   - **Example:** Notification service sending updates to multiple subscribers.

**Benefits of Messaging Systems:**
1. **Messaging Buffering:** Handles spikes in incoming messages by temporarily storing them until processing is possible.
2. **Guarantee of Message Delivery:** Ensures that messages are eventually delivered even if the consumer is temporarily unavailable.
3. **Providing Abstraction:** Decouples sender and receiver, allowing independent evolution and modularity.
4. **Scalability:** Handles large message volumes and scales horizontally to accommodate increased workloads.
5. **Fault Tolerance:** Operates even if a node fails, providing redundancy and increased reliability.
6. **Asynchronous Communication:** Enables components to process messages at their own pace, improving performance and responsiveness.
7. **Load Balancing:** Distributes messages across multiple nodes to avoid bottlenecks, improving resource utilization and performance.
8. **Message Persistence:** Ensures messages are not lost if a receiver is temporarily unavailable, maintaining data consistency and reliability.
9. **Security:** Supports encryption and authentication to protect data and prevent unauthorized access.
10. **Interoperability:** Supports multiple messaging protocols, integrating with various platforms and technologies to connect different system components.

#### Introduction to Kafka

**What is Kafka?**
Apache Kafka is an open-source, distributed, publish-subscribe messaging system. It is designed to be durable, fault-tolerant, and highly scalable. Kafka handles streams of messages from producers, stores them reliably, and delivers them to consumers.

**Background:**
Created at LinkedIn in 2010, Kafka was designed to track various events like page views and logs. It was later made open-source and has since become a comprehensive system for:

1. Storing large amounts of data reliably.
2. Enabling high throughput of message transfer.
3. Streaming real-time data.

**Kafka use cases**

| Use Case                 | Description                                                                                          | Example                                                                                                        |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

### DNS
**Introduction to DNS**
![alt text](https://github.com/madhavkosi/designPatterningolang/blob/main/SystemDesign/image%20folder/1.png)
**What is DNS (Domain Name System)?**
DNS translates human-readable domain names (e.g., www.example.com) into IP addresses (e.g., 198.47.25.1) that computers use to identify each other on the internet. It functions like an internet phonebook, enabling users to access websites using easy-to-remember names instead of numeric IP addresses.

**Purpose and Importance of DNS:**
1. **User-Friendliness:** Domain names are easier to remember and type than IP addresses.
2. **Scalability:** DNS is distributed and hierarchical, handling the vast number of domain names and IP addresses.
3. **Flexibility:** Allows IP address changes without affecting users by updating DNS records.
4. **Load Balancing:** Distributes user requests across multiple servers to improve performance and reliability.

**DNS Components and Terminology:**

1. **Domain Names, TLDs, and Subdomains:**
   - **Domain Names:** Human-readable addresses for websites (e.g., www.example.com).
   - **TLDs (Top-Level Domains):** The rightmost part of a domain name (e.g., .com, .org, .uk).
   - **Subdomains:** Subdivisions of a domain name (e.g., blog.example.com).

2. **DNS Servers:**
   - **Root Servers:** Direct queries to the appropriate TLD servers. There are 13 root server clusters worldwide.
   - **TLD Servers:** Store information about domain names within their specific TLD and direct queries to authoritative name servers.
   - **Authoritative Name Servers:** Hold the DNS records for a domain and provide the final answers to DNS queries.

3. **DNS Resolvers (Caching and Forwarding):**
   - **DNS Resolvers:** Intermediaries provided by ISPs that resolve DNS queries by contacting the appropriate DNS servers.
   - **Caching Resolvers:** Store previously resolved queries to speed up future requests.
   - **Forwarding Resolvers:** Forward queries to another resolver, usually a caching resolver, for better control and performance.


**DNS Resolution Process**

**Overview:**
DNS resolution translates human-readable domain names into machine-readable IP addresses. This process involves recursive and iterative queries using a distributed and hierarchical infrastructure of DNS servers, resolvers, and caching mechanisms.

**1. Recursive and Iterative DNS Queries:**

- **Recursive Query:**
  - The DNS resolver requests the complete answer from the DNS server.
  - If the server has the answer, it responds with the required information.
  - If not, the server contacts other DNS servers to find the answer and returns it to the resolver.
  - **Responsibility:** The DNS server takes on the responsibility of finding the requested information.

- **Iterative Query:**
  - The DNS resolver asks the DNS server for the best answer it has at the moment.
  - If the server doesn't have the complete answer, it provides a referral to another server.
  - The resolver then contacts the referred server, repeating the process until it finds the complete answer.
  - **Responsibility:** The DNS resolver takes on the responsibility of finding the requested information.

**2. DNS Caching and TTL (Time To Live):**

- **DNS Caching:**
  - Resolvers and servers store the results of previous queries to speed up the resolution process.
  - When a resolver receives a query, it first checks its cache for the answer.
  - If the answer is in the cache, it is returned without contacting other servers, saving time and reducing network traffic.

- **TTL (Time To Live):**
  - Each DNS record has an associated TTL value, specifying how long the record should be stored in the cache.
  - TTL is measured in seconds. Once it expires, the cached information is removed to prevent outdated data from being used.

**3. Negative Caching:**

- **Definition:**
  - Negative caching stores the non-existence of a DNS record.
  - When a resolver queries a non-existent domain or record, it caches this negative response.
  - This prevents repeated queries for the same non-existent resource, reducing DNS server load and improving performance.

**Summary:**
The DNS resolution process involves converting domain names into IP addresses using recursive and iterative queries. DNS caching speeds up this process by storing previous query results, with TTL values determining the cache duration. Negative caching helps improve performance by storing the non-existence of DNS records.

**DNS Load Balancing and High Availability**

Ensuring the performance, reliability, and availability of DNS is crucial as internet usage grows. Techniques like round-robin DNS, geographically distributed servers, anycast routing, and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) help distribute the load, reduce latency, and maintain uninterrupted service.

**1. Round-Robin DNS:**
- **Description:** Associates multiple IP addresses with a single domain name and rotates responses among them.
- **Benefit:** Distributes load among multiple servers.
- **Limitation:** Does not account for actual server load or client location, potentially leading to uneven distribution and increased latency.

**2. Geographically Distributed DNS Servers:**
- **Description:** Deploys DNS servers in various geographic locations.
- **Benefits:**
  - **Performance:** Faster DNS resolution for users closer to the server.
  - **Redundancy:** Increased reliability as users can still access services if one server fails.

**3. Anycast Routing:**
- **Description:** Multiple servers share the same IP address, and the network routes queries to the nearest server based on factors like latency and availability.
- **Benefits:**
  - **Load Balancing:** Distributes queries among multiple servers.
  - **Reduced Latency:** Directs users to the nearest server for faster resolution.
  - **High Availability:** Automatically redirects queries if a server fails, ensuring continuous service.

**4. Content Delivery Networks (CDNs):**
- **Description:** A network of distributed servers that cache and deliver content based on the user's location.
- **Role of DNS in CDNs:**
  - **Load Distribution:** CDN's DNS server determines the best server to deliver content based on the user's location and other factors.
  - **Performance:** Serves content from the nearest server, improving load times and reliability.

**Summary:**
DNS load balancing and high availability techniques enhance the performance and reliability of web services by distributing the load across multiple servers and reducing latency for users. Key techniques include:
- **Round-Robin DNS:** Simple load distribution but with potential limitations in efficiency.
- **Geographically Distributed Servers:** Improves performance and redundancy.
- **Anycast Routing:** Optimizes load balancing and reduces latency.
- **CDNs:** Enhances content delivery performance and reliability by leveraging DNS for optimal server selection.

### CDN

**What is a CDN?**
<p float="left">
  <img src="https://github.com/madhavkosi/designPatterningolang/blob/main/SystemDesign/image%20folder/cdn.svg" width="500" />
</p>

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a distributed network of servers strategically located across various geographical areas to deliver web content (e.g., images, videos, static assets) more efficiently to users. CDNs reduce latency and improve the overall performance, reliability, and security of web applications by serving content from the nearest server.

**How CDNs Work**

When a user requests content:
1. The request is routed to the nearest CDN server (edge server) based on factors like network latency and server load.
2. The edge server checks if the content is cached.
3. If cached, the content is served directly.
4. If not cached, the edge server fetches the content from the origin server, caches it, and then serves it to the user.
5. Subsequent requests for the same content are served from the cache, reducing latency and offloading traffic from the origin server.

**Key Terminology and Concepts**

1. **Point of Presence (PoP):** A physical location with CDN servers, strategically placed to minimize latency and improve content delivery performance.
2. **Edge Server:** A server at a PoP that caches and delivers content to end-users.
3. **Origin Server:** The primary server where original content is stored.
4. **Cache Warming:** Preloading content into the edge server's cache before user requests to ensure fast delivery.
5. **Time to Live (TTL):** Determines how long content is stored in the cache before needing a refresh from the origin server.
6. **Anycast:** A network routing technique directing user requests to the nearest edge server based on the lowest latency or shortest network path.
7. **Content Invalidation:** Removing or updating cached content when the original content changes to ensure users receive the latest version.
8. **Cache Purging:** Forcibly removing content from the cache, either manually or automatically, based on specific conditions.

**Benefits of Using a CDN**

1. **Reduced Latency:** Serving content from edge servers close to users results in faster load times and improved user experience.
2. **Improved Performance:** Offloading static content delivery from the origin server frees up resources for dynamic content generation and reduces server load.
3. **Enhanced Reliability and Availability:** Built-in redundancy and fault tolerance with multiple edge servers in different locations ensure continuous content delivery.
4. **Scalability:** Handles sudden traffic spikes and large volumes of concurrent requests, making it easier to scale web applications.
5. **Security:** Provides additional security features like DDoS protection, Web Application Firewalls (WAF), and SSL/TLS termination at the edge, protecting web applications from various threats.


**CDN Architecture**

**Points of Presence (PoPs) and Edge Servers:**
- **PoP:** A physical location with multiple edge servers, strategically located to minimize user latency.
- **Edge Servers:** Store cached content and serve it to users, reducing the need to fetch from the origin server.

**CDN Routing and Request Handling:**
- **Anycast Routing:** Multiple servers share a single IP, and the network directs requests to the nearest server.
- **DNS-based Routing:** CDN's DNS server directs requests to the most suitable edge server based on proximity and load.
- **GeoIP-based Routing:** Directs requests to the nearest edge server based on the user's IP location.

**Caching Mechanisms:**
- **Time-to-Live (TTL):** Determines how long content stays in the cache before being refreshed.
- **Cache Invalidation:** Removes content from the cache before TTL expires when updates or deletions occur.
- **Cache Control Headers:** Origin server provides caching instructions to the CDN, such as cacheability and TTL.

**CDN Network Topologies:**

### Introduction to Data Partitioning

**Data Partitioning**: Technique to divide a large dataset into smaller, manageable parts (partitions) in distributed systems and databases.

**Key Concepts**:
- **Partition**: Independent subset of the overall data.
- **Partition Key**: Attribute used to determine data distribution across partitions.
- **Shard**: Term often used interchangeably with partition, especially in horizontal partitioning.

**Benefits**:
- **Improved Performance**: Distributes processing across multiple nodes, reducing data transfer and processing time.
- **Enhanced Scalability**: Balances workload across nodes, handling more requests efficiently.



Here is a comparison of partitioning methods in a table format with short notes:

|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Horizontal Partitioning (Sharding) | Divides a table into multiple partitions or shards, each containing a subset of rows. | Social media platform partitioning user data by geographic location.    | - Enables parallel processing.<br>- Faster query execution. | - Risk of unbalanced servers if partitioning criteria are not carefully chosen. |
| Vertical Partitioning        | Splits a table into partitions, each containing a subset of columns.                    | E-commerce site partitioning customer data into personal info and order history. | - Reduces data scanned for queries.<br>- Optimizes performance. | - Complexity in managing relationships between vertically partitioned data. |
| Hybrid Partitioning          | Combines horizontal and vertical partitioning.                                          | E-commerce site partitioning customer data by geographic location (horizontal) and data type (vertical). | - Balances data distribution.<br>- Minimizes data scanned. | - Increased complexity in implementation and management. |

**Conclusion**

Designing an effective partitioning scheme requires careful consideration of application requirements and data characteristics. 

- **Horizontal Partitioning (Sharding)**: Best for parallel processing and faster query execution, but requires careful criteria selection to avoid unbalanced servers.
- **Vertical Partitioning**: Optimizes performance by reducing data scanned for queries, but managing relationships between partitioned data can be complex.
- **Hybrid Partitioning**: Offers balanced data distribution and minimized data scanning, but is more complex to implement and manage.

Choosing the right partitioning method depends on the specific needs of the application, such as data distribution, query performance, and management complexity.
