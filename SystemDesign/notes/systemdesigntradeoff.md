### Read-Heavy Systems

**Characteristics**: High volume of read operations compared to writes (e.g., content delivery networks, reporting systems).

| **Key Strategies**           | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                   | **Example**                                                                                      |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Caching**                  | Implement extensive caching to reduce database reads. Cache at different levels: application, database, or dedicated caching service.                                             | A news website caches frequently accessed articles in Redis.                                     |
| **Database Replication**     | Create read replicas of the primary database for distributing read operations. Ensure eventual consistency between primary and replicas.                                           | An e-commerce platform uses multiple read replicas for browsing products.                        |
| **Content Delivery Network** | Use CDNs to cache static content closer to users.                                                                                                                                 | A streaming service caches images and videos in a CDN.                                           |
| **Load Balancing**           | Distribute incoming read requests evenly across servers or replicas.                                                                                                              | A cloud application uses a load balancer to distribute read queries across a server cluster.     |
| **Optimized Data Retrieval** | Design efficient data access patterns and optimize queries. Use data indexing to speed up searches.                                                                               | An analytics dashboard optimizes SQL queries with proper indexing.                               |
| **Data Partitioning**        | Distribute load across different servers or databases (sharding).                                                                                                                 | A social media platform shards user data by geographic location.                                 |
| **Asynchronous Processing**  | Use asynchronous processing for non-real-time operations.                                                                                                                         | A financial app pre-computes reports asynchronously for quick retrieval.                         |

### Write-Heavy Systems

**Characteristics**: High volume of write operations (e.g., logging systems, real-time data collection).

| **Key Strategies**                  | **Description**                                                                                                                                                      | **Example**                                                                                           |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Database Optimization for Writes**| Choose databases optimized for write throughput (e.g., NoSQL: Cassandra, MongoDB). Optimize schema and indexes for writes.                                           | A real-time analytics system uses Cassandra for high write efficiency.                                |
| **Write Batching and Buffering**    | Batch multiple write operations to reduce write requests.                                                                                                            | A logging system batches log entries before writing to the database.                                  |
| **Asynchronous Processing**         | Handle writes asynchronously, allowing continued processing without waiting.                                                                                         | A video platform processes uploads asynchronously, queuing them for background processing.            |
| **CQRS**                            | Separate write (command) and read (query) operations into different models.                                                                                          | A financial system separates transaction processing from balance inquiries.                           |
| **Data Partitioning**               | Use sharding to distribute write operations across multiple database instances.                                                                                      | A social media app shards user data based on user IDs for distributed writes.                         |
| **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)**       | Write changes to a log before applying them to the database for data integrity.                                                                                       | A database uses WAL to ensure recovery and data integrity after crashes.                              |
| **Event Sourcing**                  | Persist changes as immutable events rather than modifying the database state directly.                                                                               | An order management system stores changes as separate events for efficient processing.                |
