## Read-Through vs Write-Through Cache

| **Aspect**                | **Read-Through Cache**                                                                                                                | **Write-Through Cache**                                                                                                           |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**            | Data is loaded into the cache on demand, typically when a read request occurs for data not already in the cache.                       | Data is written simultaneously to the cache and the primary storage system, ensuring the cache always contains the most recent data.|
| **Process**               | - Cache checks for data availability (cache hit).                                                                                      | - Data is written first to the cache.                                                                                            |
|                           | - On cache miss, data is fetched from primary storage, stored in the cache, and then returned to the client.                           | - Simultaneously, data is written to primary storage.                                                                            |
|                           | - Subsequent reads are served from the cache until data expires or is evicted.                                                         | - Read requests are served from the cache, which contains up-to-date data.                                                       |
| **Pros**                  | - Ensures consistency between cache and primary storage.                                                                               | - Provides strong consistency between cache and primary storage.                                                                  |
|                           | - Reduces load on primary storage by offloading frequent read operations.                                                              | - No data loss on cache failure as data is also in primary storage.                                                              |
| **Cons**                  | - Initial read requests (cache misses) incur latency due to data fetching from primary storage.                                        | - Each write operation incurs latency due to simultaneous writing to cache and primary storage.                                   |
|                           |                                                                                                                                         | - Higher load on primary storage due to every write request impacting it.                                                        |
| **Example**               | **Online Product Catalog:**                                                                                                            | **Banking System Transaction:**                                                                                                  |
|                           | - Cache Miss: On customer search for a product not in cache, system experiences cache miss.                                             | - Transaction Execution: User makes a transaction (e.g., deposit), transaction details are written to cache.                     |
|                           | - Fetching and Caching: System fetches product details from primary database and stores in cache.                                      | - Simultaneous Database Write: Transaction is also recorded in the primary database.                                             |
|                           | - Subsequent Requests: Future searches for the same product are served from cache.                                                     | - Consistent Data: Ensures cached data is up-to-date with database for fast retrieval.                                           |
|                           | - Reduced Database Load: Popular product queries served from cache reduce primary database load.                                       | - Data Integrity: Ensures cache and database synchronization, reducing risk of discrepancies.                                    |

## REST vs RPC

| **Aspect**                  | **REST (Representational State Transfer)**                                                                 | **RPC (Remote Procedure Call)**                                                                                    |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Concept**                 | Architectural style using HTTP requests to access and manipulate data. Treats server data as resources.    | Protocol allowing a program to execute a procedure in another address space, typically on another networked computer. |
| **Communication**           | Uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for CRUD operations on resources.                       | Clients and servers communicate through explicit remote procedure calls.                                           |
| **Stateless**               | Yes, each request contains all the necessary information.                                                   | Can be stateful, maintaining client context between requests.                                                      |
| **Data and Resources**      | Emphasizes resources identified by URLs, data transferred over HTTP in formats like JSON or XML.            | Procedure-oriented, using various formats like JSON (JSON-RPC), XML (XML-RPC), or binary formats like Protocol Buffers (gRPC). |
| **Example**                 | URL like `http://example.com/articles` to access articles. GET retrieves articles, POST creates a new article. | Method `getArticle(articleId)` on a remote server, which returns article details.                                    |
| **Advantages**              | - **Scalability:** Stateless interactions improve scalability.                                              | - **Tight Coupling:** Straightforward mapping of actions to server-side operations.                                |
|                             | - **Performance:** Can leverage HTTP caching.                                                               | - **Efficiency:** Binary RPC (like gRPC) can be more efficient and faster.                                         |
|                             | - **Simplicity and Flexibility:** Uses standard HTTP methods.                                               | - **Clear Contract:** Procedure definitions create a clear contract between client and server.                      |
| **Disadvantages**           | - **Over-fetching or Under-fetching:** Might retrieve more or less data than needed.                         | - **Less Flexible:** Tightly coupled to server methods.                                                            |
|                             | - **Standardization:** Lacks a strict standard, leading to varied implementations.                          | - **Stateful Interactions:** Can reduce scalability.                                                               |
| **Best For**                | Web services and public APIs needing scalability, caching, and uniform interface.                           | Actions tightly coupled to server operations, where efficiency and speed are critical, like internal microservices.  |
| **Conclusion**              | Suited for scalable, flexible web services and public APIs with stateless interactions.                     | Chosen for tightly coupled actions, efficiency, and speed, particularly in internal communications.                |

Short Notes:
1. **REST (Representational State Transfer)**: Uses HTTP requests for CRUD operations on resources, emphasizing scalability and flexibility. Ideal for web services and public APIs.
2. **RPC (Remote Procedure Call)**: Allows execution of procedures on remote servers, focusing on efficiency and tight coupling. Suitable for internal microservices communication where speed is critical.
3. **Advantages and Disadvantages**: REST is scalable and flexible but can suffer from over-fetching/under-fetching and lacks strict standardization. RPC provides clear contracts and efficiency but is less flexible and can be stateful.
4. **Use Cases**: REST for scalable and flexible web services; RPC for tightly coupled server operations requiring efficiency and speed.

|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Polling        | The client repeatedly requests (polls) a server at regular intervals to get new or updated data.     | - Regular Requests: Client makes requests at fixed intervals.<br>- Client-Initiated: Client initiates each request.         | A weather app that checks for updated weather information every 15 minutes by sending a request to the server. | - Simple to Implement: Easy to set up on the client side.      | - Inefficient: Generates unnecessary traffic and server load.<br>- Delay in Updates: Delayed response to actual updates. |
| Long-Polling   | An enhanced version of polling where the server holds the request open until new data is available.  | - Open Connection: Server keeps connection open until new data or timeout.<br>- Reduced Traffic: Less frequent requests.    | A chat application where the client sends a request and the server responds when new messages are available.  | - More Timely Updates: Quick response to updates.<br>- Reduced Network Traffic: Less frequent requests. | - Resource Intensive: Consumes server resources by holding connections open.                       |
| Webhooks       | User-defined HTTP callbacks triggered by specific events, where the server sends data when updates occur. | - Server-Initiated: Server sends data without client requests.<br>- Event-Driven: Triggered by specific server events.      | A project management tool notifying a team's chat application when a new task is created via webhook.         | - Real-Time: Provides real-time updates.<br>- Efficient: Reduces network traffic and load.      | - Complexity: Client must handle incoming HTTP requests.<br>- Security Considerations: Secure handling needed.      |

**Key Differences**
- **Initiation and Traffic**: 
  - Polling: Client-initiated with frequent traffic.
  - Long-Polling: Client-initiated but reduces traffic by keeping the request open.
  - Webhooks: Server-initiated, no polling required.

- **Real-Time Updates**: 
  - Webhooks offer the most real-time updates.
  - Polling and long-polling have inherent delays.

| Aspect            | Stateful Architecture                                                                                              | Stateless Architecture                                                                                      |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Definition        | The server retains information (state) about the client's session for future interactions.                         | Each request contains all necessary information, and the server doesn't rely on previous interactions.      |
| Characteristics   | - Session Memory: Server remembers past session data.<br>- Dependency on Context: Responses depend on previous interactions. | - No Session Memory: Server doesn't store any state about the client's session.<br>- Self-contained Requests: Each request is independent. |
| Example           | An online banking application where the server maintains session data for user interactions like authentication and transaction history. | RESTful APIs where each HTTP request contains all the information needed for processing, without relying on previous requests. |
| Pros              | - Personalized Interaction: More personalized user experiences.<br>- Easier to Manage Continuous Transactions: Suitable for multi-step transactions. | - Simplicity and Scalability: Easier to scale without maintaining session state.<br>- Predictability: Independent request processing. |
| Cons              | - Resource Intensive: Maintaining state consumes more server resources.<br>- Scalability Challenges: More complex to scale due to session dependencies. | - Redundancy: Data may be redundant in each request.<br>- Potentially More Complex Requests: Clients handle more complexities in preparing requests. |
| Key Differences   | - Session Memory: Retains user session information.<br>- Server Design: More complex and resource-intensive.         | - Session Memory: Treats each request as an isolated transaction.<br>- Server Design: Simpler and more scalable. |
| Use Cases         | Suitable for applications requiring continuous user interactions and personalization.                                | Ideal for services where each request can be processed independently, like many web APIs.                     |

### Key Differences

- **Session Memory**:
  - **Stateful**: Retains user session information, influencing future interactions.
  - **Stateless**: Treats each request as an isolated transaction, independent of previous requests.

- **Server Design**:
  - **Stateful**: Maintains state, making it more complex and resource-intensive.
  - **Stateless**: Simpler and more scalable, with no need to maintain session state.

### Conclusion

- **Stateful Architecture**: Provides a more personalized user experience but requires more resources and complexity to manage session states. Suitable for applications with continuous user interactions and multi-step transactions.
- **Stateless Architecture**: Offers simplicity, scalability, and predictability, making it ideal for distributed systems and services where each request can be processed independently, such as RESTful APIs.

In summary, the choice between stateful and stateless architecture depends on the application's requirements for personalization, resource availability, and scalability. Stateful offers a richer user experience with more complexity, while stateless provides simplicity and ease of scaling with less resource overhead.
