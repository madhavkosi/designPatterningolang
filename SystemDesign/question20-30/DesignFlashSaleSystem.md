### Functional Requirements for Flash Sale System:

1. **Limited Stock Availability**: The system must handle a limited inventory (e.g., 1000 items) and ensure that no more items are sold once the stock is depleted.

2. **First-Come-First-Served**: The system must allocate items to users on a first-come-first-served basis, ensuring fairness and consistency.

3. **High Traffic Handling**: The system must be capable of handling millions or even billions of requests in a short period during the flash sale.

4. **Real-time Inventory Updates**: Inventory levels must be updated in real-time, and no overselling should occur.

5. **Cart Reservation**: Once an item is added to the cart, it must be reserved for a limited time (e.g., 5 minutes), after which the item is returned to the available stock if not purchased.

6. **Order Processing**: The system should allow users to complete orders via a secure checkout, integrating with multiple payment gateways.

7. **User Notifications**: Users must be notified via email/SMS upon successful order placement or stock exhaustion.

8. **Scalability**: The system must scale to accommodate millions of concurrent users, ensuring low latency for all operations (inventory checks, adding to cart, checkout).

9. **Bot Prevention**: Mechanisms to detect and block bot traffic, ensuring only legitimate users can participate in the sale.

### Non-Functional Requirements for Flash Sale System:

1. **Performance**:
   - The system should be able to handle high volumes of traffic with minimal latency (targeting response times of under 100ms for most operations).
   - Inventory updates and checkout processes should be completed in real-time, ensuring users have up-to-date information.

2. **Scalability**:
   - The system must scale horizontally to accommodate sudden spikes in traffic during a flash sale event, potentially handling billions of requests.
   - The architecture should support dynamic scaling to handle increased loads and reduced traffic outside of flash sales.

3. **Availability**:
   - The system must ensure **99.99% uptime**, especially during the flash sale event. Downtime during the sale can result in significant business losses and customer dissatisfaction.
   - Fault-tolerance mechanisms should be in place to handle failures gracefully.

4. **Reliability**:
   - All order processes and inventory updates should be reliable, ensuring consistency in stock levels and no duplicate orders or overselling.

5. **Consistency**:
   - **Strong consistency** is required for critical operations like inventory reduction during checkout to ensure no overselling of items.

6. **Security**:
   - User data (e.g., payment information, personal details) must be handled securely, following encryption standards like TLS for data in transit and AES for data at rest.
   - Implement bot protection mechanisms such as CAPTCHA and rate-limiting.

7. **Resilience**:
   - The system must handle unexpected failures gracefully, ensuring no data loss and maintaining functionality during partial outages.

8. **Graceful Degradation**:
   - In the event of high traffic or component failures, the system should degrade gracefully (e.g., slower response times but no crashes), rather than failing completely.

9. **Compliance**:
   - The system should adhere to relevant regulations such as PCI DSS (for handling payment information) and GDPR (for protecting personal data in the EU).


### Capacity Estimation for Flash Sale System:

1. **Users**:
   - Assume the system needs to handle up to **100 million users** during the flash sale, with **10 million concurrent users** actively interacting with the system at peak times.

2. **Requests per Second (RPS)**:
   - Each user may generate 5 requests (view product, add to cart, check inventory, checkout, and payment). For 10 million concurrent users, the system must handle:
     ``` 
     10,000,000 users * 5 requests = 50,000,000 requests over a 10-minute window.
     ```
     This translates to **83,333 requests per second (RPS)**.

3. **Inventory Updates**:
   - For an inventory of 1,000 units, there will be 1,000 atomic inventory updates, but the system needs to handle checking inventory availability potentially millions of times as users compete for the same items.

4. **Data Storage**:
   - If each order record is approximately 1KB (including user data, order details, and payment status), with 1 million completed orders, the system will store around **1 GB of order data**.

5. **Bandwidth**:
   - Assuming each request/response (e.g., adding to cart, inventory checks) is around 2KB, handling **83,333 RPS** results in:
     ```
     83,333 RPS * 2KB = 166,666 KB/s = ~162 MB/s of bandwidth.
     ```

6. **Latency Targets**:
   - **Sub-100ms latency** for critical operations like inventory checks and order placements to ensure a smooth user experience.

7. **Payment Processing**:
   - If 10% of users complete purchases (1 million users), and payment processing takes around 2-3 seconds per transaction, the system should handle **333 transactions per second**.

### High-Level Design for Flash Sale System:

The high-level architecture for the flash sale system is built to handle extreme traffic spikes, ensure real-time inventory management, prevent overselling, and maintain system stability and availability. Here's an architectural overview of the key components and their interactions:

#### 1. **User Interface (UI) Layer**:
   - **Users** access the flash sale system via **web** or **mobile applications**.
   - Users can browse products, add items to the cart, and complete purchases through the UI, which communicates with the backend via APIs.

#### 2. **API Gateway**:
   - **Role**: Acts as the entry point for all client requests (add to cart, check inventory, checkout, etc.).
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - **Load Balancing**: Distributes incoming traffic across microservices.
     - **Rate Limiting**: Controls traffic to prevent bot abuse and ensure fair access.
     - **Authentication**: Validates user tokens and sessions.
     - **Routing**: Routes requests to the appropriate backend services (Inventory Service, Order Service, etc.).
   
   - **Technologies**: **AWS API Gateway**, **NGINX**, or **Kong**.

#### 3. **Inventory Service**:
   - **Role**: Manages the real-time inventory of products and ensures no overselling.
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - Responds to inventory availability checks when users add items to the cart.
     - Performs atomic updates to deduct stock when an order is confirmed.
     - Handles potential race conditions through Redis atomic operations or database row locking.
   
   - **Technologies**: **Redis** (for fast real-time inventory management), **PostgreSQL** or **Cassandra** for persistence.

#### 4. **Cart Service**:
   - **Role**: Manages user cart sessions, including item reservation and expiration.
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - Adds items to the cart and reserves stock for a limited time.
     - Ensures that items reserved in the cart are released back to inventory if the cart expires without checkout.
   
   - **Technologies**: **Redis** (to store temporary cart data with expiration times), **PostgreSQL**.

#### 5. **Order Management Service**:
   - **Role**: Handles order creation, processing, and status updates.
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - Creates and stores orders once the user proceeds to checkout.
     - Updates the order status based on payment success or failure.
     - Ensures that inventory is deducted only after payment is confirmed.
   
   - **Technologies**: **PostgreSQL** for order persistence, **RabbitMQ** for processing order events.

#### 6. **Payment Service**:
   - **Role**: Integrates with external payment gateways to securely process payments.
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - Receives payment details from the user and processes transactions through gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).
     - Updates the order status in the Order Management Service based on payment outcome.
   
   - **Technologies**: **Stripe API**, **PayPal API**, **PostgreSQL** for payment transaction records.

#### 7. **Notification Service**:
   - **Role**: Sends real-time notifications to users about the status of their orders and the sale.
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - Sends emails or SMS notifications to users upon successful order placement, cart expiration, or low stock alerts.
   
   - **Technologies**: **SendGrid**, **Twilio**, **AWS SNS**.

#### 8. **Database Layer**:
   - **Role**: Stores persistent data, such as product inventory, order history, payment records, and user cart data.
   - **Technologies**:
     - **PostgreSQL**: For strong consistency and ACID transactions, particularly for orders, inventory, and payments.
     - **Redis**: For real-time data like inventory and cart expiration management.
     - **Cassandra** (optional): For distributed systems handling massive concurrent transactions across multiple data centers.

#### 9. **Message Queue (Optional)**:
   - **Role**: Decouples services and ensures asynchronous communication between them.
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - Handles events such as order creation, payment status updates, and inventory changes asynchronously to offload pressure from synchronous APIs.
   
   - **Technologies**: **RabbitMQ**, **Apache Kafka**.

---

### Interaction Flow:
1. **User adds item to cart**:
   - The request hits the **API Gateway**, which routes it to the **Cart Service**.
   - The **Inventory Service** is queried via Redis to check availability, and if stock is available, it is reserved for the user temporarily.
   
2. **User checks out**:
   - The **Order Management Service** creates an order and reserves the item.
   - The **Payment Service** processes the payment, and upon confirmation, the **Inventory Service** reduces the stock permanently.

3. **Payment and Notification**:
   - Once the payment is successful, the order is confirmed, and the **Notification Service** sends an order confirmation email/SMS.

---

This high-level design ensures the system is capable of handling millions of concurrent users, guarantees strong consistency for inventory management, and can scale horizontally as needed.


### Request Flows for Flash Sale System:

Here, we'll describe the lifecycle of key operations from initiation to completion in a flash sale system.

#### 1. **User Adds Item to Cart** (Add to Cart Flow):
   - **Step 1**: The user clicks "Add to Cart" in the front-end UI (web/mobile).
   - **Step 2**: The request is sent to the **API Gateway**.
   - **Step 3**: The **API Gateway** forwards the request to the **Cart Service**.
   - **Step 4**: The **Cart Service** checks the **Inventory Service** (through Redis) to ensure there is available stock for the product.
   - **Step 5**: If stock is available, the item is added to the user's cart in Redis, and the stock is reserved for a limited time (e.g., 5 minutes). The expiration time is tracked by Redis.
   - **Step 6**: A response is sent back to the user, confirming that the item has been added to the cart and specifying the reservation expiration time.

#### 2. **User Checks Out** (Checkout and Order Flow):
   - **Step 1**: The user clicks "Checkout" in the UI to proceed with purchasing the items in their cart.
   - **Step 2**: The request is sent to the **API Gateway** and forwarded to the **Order Management Service**.
   - **Step 3**: The **Order Management Service** verifies that the cart reservation has not expired by checking Redis.
   - **Step 4**: The **Inventory Service** (using Redis and PostgreSQL) is queried to ensure that the reserved inventory is still valid.
   - **Step 5**: The **Order Management Service** creates an order record in the database (PostgreSQL), marking the order status as "pending".
   - **Step 6**: The **Order Management Service** forwards the request to the **Payment Service** for payment processing.

#### 3. **Payment Processing** (Payment Flow):
   - **Step 1**: The **Payment Service** receives the payment request, validates the payment method, and processes the payment through a third-party payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).
   - **Step 2**: Upon successful payment, the **Payment Service** updates the payment status to "completed" and informs the **Order Management Service**.
   - **Step 3**: The **Order Management Service** updates the order status to "completed" and confirms the transaction.
   - **Step 4**: The **Inventory Service** permanently deducts the inventory from Redis and PostgreSQL to reflect the actual stock change.
   - **Step 5**: The system sends a success response to the user, confirming that the order has been placed and payment has been successful.

#### 4. **Cart Expiration and Inventory Restoration** (Expiration Flow):
   - **Step 1**: If the user does not complete the checkout process within the reserved time window (e.g., 5 minutes), the cart expiration logic kicks in.
   - **Step 2**: A background task checks Redis for expired carts and releases the reserved inventory back to the pool.
   - **Step 3**: The **Cart Service** removes the expired cart items, and the **Inventory Service** restores the inventory in both Redis and the primary database (PostgreSQL).

#### 5. **Order Notification** (Notification Flow):
   - **Step 1**: Once the order is successfully processed, the **Order Management Service** sends an event to the **Notification Service** (via RabbitMQ or other messaging queue).
   - **Step 2**: The **Notification Service** sends an email or SMS to the user, confirming the order and providing details like estimated delivery, order summary, and payment confirmation.

---

### Summary of Request Flows:
- **Add to Cart Flow**: Involves cart reservation with inventory checks in Redis, followed by temporary stock reservation.
- **Checkout and Order Flow**: Involves verifying cart reservations, processing orders, and managing payments.
- **Payment Flow**: Integrates with external payment gateways to process the payment and update order statuses.
- **Expiration Flow**: Handles cart expirations and restores inventory to ensure availability for other users.
- **Notification Flow**: Sends real-time notifications to users upon successful order placements.

### Failure Scenarios/Bottlenecks for Flash Sale System:

In a flash sale system handling massive traffic, several weak points could cause failures or performance degradation. Let’s look at potential failure scenarios and how the system can handle them:

#### 1. **Server Overload (High Traffic Overload)**:
   - **Scenario**: Millions of users accessing the system simultaneously could overwhelm servers, causing slow responses or downtime.
   - **Mitigation**:
     - **Horizontal Scaling**: Use Kubernetes or cloud auto-scaling to spin up additional servers when traffic spikes occur.
     - **Load Balancers**: Use load balancers like NGINX or AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) to distribute traffic across multiple server instances.
     - **Rate Limiting**: Apply rate limiting via API Gateway to throttle excessive requests from bots or abusive users.

#### 2. **Inventory Overselling**:
   - **Scenario**: Multiple users simultaneously purchasing limited-stock items can lead to overselling if inventory updates aren’t handled atomically.
   - **Mitigation**:
     - **Atomic Inventory Updates**: Use Redis with Lua scripts or database transactions (PostgreSQL) to handle inventory decrement in a single atomic operation.
     - **Distributed Locks**: Implement Redis distributed locks (e.g., Redlock) to ensure that only one transaction can reduce the inventory at a time.

#### 3. **Database Bottlenecks**:
   - **Scenario**: High read/write load on the database during flash sales (e.g., order creation, inventory updates) could lead to slow queries or system crashes.
   - **Mitigation**:
     - **Read/Write Replication**: Use read replicas to handle read-heavy traffic, while ensuring that write operations (e.g., orders, payments) go to the master database.
     - **Sharding**: Partition the database to distribute the load across multiple servers.
     - **Redis Caching**: Cache frequently read data (e.g., product inventory) in Redis to reduce load on the database.

#### 4. **Cache Inconsistency**:
   - **Scenario**: Inventory stored in the cache (Redis) may become inconsistent with the database due to race conditions or failures.
   - **Mitigation**:
     - **Write-through Cache**: Ensure updates to the database are also immediately reflected in Redis to maintain consistency.
     - **Cache Expiration Policies**: Use time-based expiration policies in Redis to automatically refresh cache entries if they become stale.

#### 5. **Payment Gateway Failures**:
   - **Scenario**: External payment gateways may fail or become slow due to high transaction volumes during a flash sale.
   - **Mitigation**:
     - **Payment Gateway Failover**: Integrate with multiple payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal). If one fails, switch to a backup gateway.
     - **Retry Mechanism**: Implement automatic retries for failed payments and ensure that users are not charged multiple times by using idempotent payment transactions.

#### 6. **Network Latency and Delays**:
   - **Scenario**: High network latency or delays could slow down user interactions (e.g., adding to cart, completing checkout), leading to poor user experience.
   - **Mitigation**:
     - **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**: Use a CDN (e.g., Cloudflare, Akamai) to cache static content (e.g., product images) closer to the user to reduce load on the origin servers and lower latency.
     - **Geographically Distributed Servers**: Deploy the system across multiple regions to reduce network latency for users in different parts of the world.

#### 7. **Bot Attacks or Abuse**:
   - **Scenario**: Bots might overwhelm the system by making thousands of requests, potentially securing limited stock unfairly or causing system overload.
   - **Mitigation**:
     - **CAPTCHA and Rate Limiting**: Implement CAPTCHA challenges and rate limiting to prevent bots from overwhelming the system.
     - **Bot Detection Algorithms**: Use bot-detection algorithms to filter out suspicious traffic and block bad actors.

#### 8. **Session Expiration or Cart Loss**:
   - **Scenario**: If users take too long to complete the checkout process, their session might expire, leading to lost carts and frustration.
   - **Mitigation**:
     - **Session Persistence in Redis**: Store user session data (including cart items) in Redis, with an expiration time that resets each time the user interacts with the system.
     - **Notifications for Cart Expiry**: Send users a notification before their cart expires to prompt them to complete the purchase.

#### 9. **Failure in Message Queue**:
   - **Scenario**: If the message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) fails, events like order confirmation or inventory updates may be delayed or lost.
   - **Mitigation**:
     - **Queue Monitoring and Retry**: Monitor message queues for failures and implement automatic retries for failed or delayed messages.
     - **Dead Letter Queue**: Use a dead letter queue to handle failed messages and retry them once the system is back online.

#### 10. **Single Point of Failure (SPOF)**:
   - **Scenario**: A critical service or component (e.g., database, Redis, load balancer) could fail, causing the entire system to crash.
   - **Mitigation**:
     - **High Availability**: Implement redundancy at all levels of the architecture (e.g., master-slave database replication, multi-node Redis clusters).
     - **Failover Mechanisms**: Use failover mechanisms for key services to automatically switch to a backup instance in case of failure (e.g., backup database replicas, load balancers).

#### 11. **Peak Load Handling**:
   - **Scenario**: The system experiences sudden traffic spikes that exceed capacity, resulting in degraded performance or downtime.
   - **Mitigation**:
     - **Auto-scaling**: Use Kubernetes or cloud-based auto-scaling to dynamically add or remove server instances based on traffic.
     - **Traffic Shaping**: Use traffic shaping techniques to prioritize high-priority operations (e.g., checkout and payment) while throttling less critical actions (e.g., browsing).

---

### Summary of Mitigations:
- **Horizontal Scaling** and **Auto-scaling** for handling traffic spikes.
- **Atomic Operations and Distributed Locks** to prevent overselling.
- **Cache Synchronization** strategies to maintain consistency between Redis and the database.
- **Multiple Payment Gateways** to ensure resilience in payment processing.
- **Bot Protection and Rate Limiting** to manage traffic and maintain system integrity.

By addressing these potential failure scenarios, the system will be robust, resilient, and capable of handling massive concurrency during a flash sale.
