### Designing a Photo-Sharing Service like Instagram

#### Overview
Instagram is a social networking service that allows users to upload, share, and view photos and videos. Users can share content publicly or privately and follow other users. A user's News Feed consists of top photos from the people they follow.

#### Requirements and Goals

**Functional Requirements:**
- Upload, download, and view photos.
- Search based on photo/video titles.
- Follow and unfollow other users.
- Generate and display a user's News Feed with top photos from followed users.

**Non-functional Requirements:**
- **High Availability:** The service must be accessible at all times.
- **Low Latency:** News Feed generation should have an acceptable latency of 200ms.
- **Consistency vs. Availability:** Prioritize availability; slight delays in photo visibility are acceptable.
- **High Reliability:** Ensure no loss of uploaded photos or videos.

**Not in Scope:**
- Adding tags, searching by tags, commenting on photos, tagging users, and recommendation systems.

   - 100 million DAUs * 2 photos/user/day = 200 million photos/day

2. **Storage Requirement per Day:**
   - 200 million photos/day * 200 KB/photo = 40 TB/day

3. **Storage Requirement per Year:**
   - 40 TB/day * 365 days/year = 14,600 TB/year â‰ˆ 14.6 PB/year

4. **Total Storage for 5 Years:**
   - 14.6 PB/year * 5 years = 73 PB

5. **Bandwidth Requirement:**
   - Assume each photo is downloaded 10 times on average.
   - Total downloads per day: 200 million photos/day * 10 = 2 billion downloads/day
   - Bandwidth required for downloads per day: 2 billion photos/day * 200 KB/photo = 400 TB/day

6. **Monthly Bandwidth Requirement:**
   - 400 TB/day * 30 days = 12 PB/month

#### Summary

### Storing Instagram-like Schema: SQL vs. NoSQL

#### SQL (e.g., MySQL)
- **Pros:** Structured data, ACID properties, efficient joins.
- **Cons:** Scalability challenges, performance bottlenecks with high loads.

#### NoSQL (e.g., Cassandra, MongoDB)
- **Pros:** Horizontal scalability, flexibility, fast read/write, reliability through replication.
- **Cons:** Eventual consistency, limited support for complex queries.

#### Hybrid Approach
- **Metadata in NoSQL:**
  - Key: `PhotoID`
  - Value: JSON object (PhotoLocation, UserLocation, CreationTimestamp, etc.)
- **Photos in Distributed Storage:**
  - Use HDFS or S3 for actual photo files.

#### NoSQL Characteristics
- **Reliability:** Multiple replicas for data availability.
- **Consistency:** Eventual consistency; support for undeleting.

### Summary
- **SQL:** For relational data needing joins and strong consistency.
- **NoSQL:** For scalable, high-throughput storage of photo metadata.
- **Photos:** Stored in distributed file storage (HDFS, S3).

Combining SQL and NoSQL leverages their strengths, ensuring scalability and performance for an Instagram-like service.


### Component Design

1. **Speed of Operations**:
   - **Photo Uploads (Writes)**: These operations are generally slow because they involve writing data to the disk.
   - **Reads**: These operations are faster, especially when served from cache.

2. **Connection Limitations**:
   - **Upload Bottleneck**: Uploading users can consume all available connections due to the slow nature of write operations.
   - **Read Availability**: When the system is busy with uploads, read requests may be delayed or unable to be served.

3. **Web Server Connection Limits**:
   - **Maximum Connections**: A typical web server may have a maximum of 500 concurrent connections.
   - **Concurrent Limits**: This means no more than 500 concurrent uploads or reads can occur simultaneously.

4. **System Design Considerations**:
   - **Separate Services**: To handle the bottleneck, separate the read and write operations into different services.
     - **Dedicated Servers**: Use dedicated servers for reads and different servers for writes.
   - **Scalability and Optimization**: 
     - **Independent Scaling**: By separating read and write services, each can be scaled independently.
     - **Optimization**: This separation allows for targeted optimization of each operation.

### Redundancy and High Availability

1. **File Redundancy**:
   - Store multiple copies of each file on different servers.
   - Ensures file retrieval if one server fails.

2. **Service Redundancy**:
   - Run multiple replicas of services.
   - Keeps the system available even if some services fail.

3. **Failover Mechanism**:
   - Secondary services can take over if primary fails.
   - Ensures continuous service availability.

4. **High Availability**:
   - Redundancy removes single points of failure.
   - Provides backup functionality in crises.
   - Failover can be automatic or manual.
