### Data Hiding in Object-Oriented Programming

**Definition**:
- Data hiding involves masking a class's internal operations, providing only an interface for interaction.
- Prevents unauthorized access or modification of a class's contents.

**Goals**:
- Ensure the internal workings of a class are not exposed.
- Enable communication between classes without revealing underlying algorithms.

### Components of Data Hiding

1. **Encapsulation**:
   - Binding data and methods within a single unit (class).
   - Hide object state and representation from the outside.
   - Declare class variables as private to restrict access.
   - Use public methods (getters and setters) to interact with the encapsulated data.

2. **Abstraction**:
   - Simplifies complexity by exposing only essential features.
   - Details on abstraction will be discussed in the next lesson.

### Implementing Encapsulation

- Create a class with private data members.
- Provide public methods for accessing and modifying these data members.
- Example of a `Movie` class with private attributes `title`, `year`, and `genre`.
  - Use public methods like `getTitle()` to access private variables.

### Advantages of Encapsulation

- Easier to modify and maintain classes.
- Control over which data members are hidden or accessible.
- Flexibility in setting variables as read-only or write-only.

### Summary

- Data hiding is crucial for secure and maintainable code in OOP.
- Encapsulation and abstraction are key techniques for achieving data hiding.
