<!--   The Adapter Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows two incompatible interfaces to work together.
This incompatibility could be because of differences in method names, argument types, or other differences in the interfaces.
The Adapter acts as a wrapper between two objects. It catches calls for one object
and transforms them to format and interface recognizable by the second object. -->
