**Introduction:**

Hello, my name is Madhav Agrawal. I have completed my postgraduate studies from IIT Delhi, where I had the opportunity to delve deep into research and publish a paper focused on the studies of equities using signed social networks. My research explored how stocks move in tandem with their groups, providing valuable insights into market dynamics.

**Professional Experience:**

After my post-graduation, I joined ColorTokens, a cybersecurity company that focuses on zero trust security. I worked on multiple projects, but the one that stands out is the visualization project. Initially, our organization served small companies with assets around 300-400. As we grew to cater to larger companies, we faced critical issues displaying all assets on a single plane. The system was making 2n^2 queries to fetch relationships between different entities, which worked for small companies but became a bottleneck as we expanded. The database and APIs started timing out frequently.

I proposed a novel solution using the adjacency matrix concept and grouping assets inside some groups while injecting them. This approach reduced the number of queries to three: one for outbound, one for inbound, and one for managed-to-managed relationships. As a result, our API stopped timing out, significantly improving performance.

**Recent Projects:**

Recently, I developed Integration Microservices to integrate our product with third-party systems. Typically, large organizations use CMDB for managing their assets and assign tags that can be leveraged on our platform. The integration process allows clients to enter their credentials on our platform to synchronize data, saving a lot of time during onboarding. For on-premise solutions, I wrote an agent for Ubuntu and RHEL that connects with the platform and writes data asynchronously.
